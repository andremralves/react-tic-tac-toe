# React Tic Tac Toe

This project is based on the React tutorial in the react documentation, but I added some improvements to make this project even cooler;

## :scroll: TODO:

- [ ] Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
- [ ] Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
- [ ] Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- [ ] Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- [ ] When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
- [ ] When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
